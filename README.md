This is an object-oriented programming project written in C++ in which temperature, humidity and pressure can be measured in a room of a smart home. The sensors related to the measurements are generated by random numbers belonging to a C++ function. The project contains several classes representing each room separately and several headers that specify the respective methods of each room and the vector in which we store the sensors.
